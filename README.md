# Data Science Internship Tasks  

A collection of tasks and projects completed during my data science internship at Prodigy InfoTech, showcasing various technical skills, data analysis, and machine learning solutions.  

## Task 1: Visualizing Data Distribution  
**Objective:** Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.  

**Key steps included:**  
- Visualizing the distribution of gender using a bar chart.  
- Analyzing the distribution of class levels (`Kelas`) with a histogram and KDE plot.  

**Dataset:**

## Task 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (Titanic Dataset)  
**Objective:** Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to explore relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.  

**Key steps included:**  
- Dataset overview: Checked for missing values and basic statistics.  
- Data cleaning:  
  - Filled missing `Age` with the median value.  
  - Replaced missing `Embarked` values with the mode.  
  - Dropped the `Cabin` column due to excessive missing values.  
- Exploratory analysis:  
  - Visualized survival counts, class distributions, and survival relationships by gender and class.  
  - Boxplot for age distribution by survival status.  
  - Heatmap showing correlations between numeric features.  
- Categorical encoding: Converted `Sex` and `Embarked` to numeric values for analysis.  
- Saved the cleaned dataset as `cleaned_titanic_data.csv`.
